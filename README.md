## About

**Note**: this is a very early release focusing on the technical aspects of the features primarily. The graphical representation is preliminary. Should you happen to be an artist and interested in creating textures and/or models please drop me a line ;)

## Features

The first feature available is chunk loading. This mod calls them "Area Stabilizers".

They have the following features:
- Each Area Stabilizer has an owner and only while the owner is online are those chunks loaded.
- Easily configurable the limit of the overall number of chunks loaded per user.
- The maximum radius of a single Area Stabilizer is configurable.
- See an in-game visualization of the currently loaded area. When inside the loaded area, you’ll see a green border. When outside, you’ll see red.

## Where to find the configuration
The configuration file is in the serverconfig folder of your world (or inside the saves folder if you are in single player).
